 
# Basic HTML & CSS Page

This is a beginner-level HTML and CSS practice project.

## Project Overview
This project is a simple web page about **Ed and Lorraine Warren**, demonstrating:
- HTML structure with headings, paragraphs, and images
- External CSS styling
- Use of `alt` attributes for images

## What I Practiced
- Basic HTML tags: `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<img>`, etc.
- Linking external CSS files
- Structuring a simple webpage
- Organizing files in a project folder

## Purpose
The goal of this project is to **build strong fundamentals in web development** before moving on to more advanced topics like JavaScript, React, and Full-Stack development.

## Files
- `Index.html` → Main HTML page
- `1.css` → CSS styling for the page
- `images.webp` → Image used in the page

## Future Plans
- Add more CSS styling and layouts
- Convert this into a responsive design
- Build more beginner projects to strengthen fundamentals
